# VQT-QuantumHeatEngine

This is the code for the paper Implementation of a two-stroke quantum heat engine with a collisional model ([arXiv:2203.13773v3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13773))

## Instructions

1. Install necessary packages with ```pip install -r requirements.txt```.
2. Inside 2_qubits folder, run 2 in order to execute VQT only.
3. 3 executes a classical simulations.
4. 4 executes the experiment in the IBMQ, in simulators (noiseless or with noise model) and real devices.
